INSTRUCTIONS!

I would HIGHLY recommend keeping the python file inside the folder it comes in. Since the major overhaul the "term_free" image is no longer needed and the script will no longer fill whatever folder it's in with all of the individual tile images. The only files the script will create now will be the finished bingo boards and a single text document containing your list of terms. All the steps to make the script function should be pretty self explanatory by all the messages inside in the script itself. Have fun and Goodluck.
