INSTRUCTIONS!

I would HIGHLY recommend keeping the python file inside the folder it comes in (It also needs to stay in a folder with the 'term_free' image). When you use this script it will fill the folder with images of all of the tiles it generates and the finalized Bingo Boards.
That's basically it. Good luck.
