INSTRUCTIONS!

I would HIGHLY recommend keeping the python file inside the folder it comes in (It also needs to stay in a folder with the 'term_free' image). When you use this script it will fill the folder with images of all of the tiles it generates and the finalized Bingo Boards. Also, when you generate a set of terms the images of those individual terms are never deleted by the script, they are simply overwritten when you create a new set. For this reason, you need to delete those term images (Besides 'term_free' of course) if your new set of terms is shorter than the previous.
That's basically it. Good luck.
